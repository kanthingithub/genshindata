  "description": "Weapon Ascension Material.\nIn the lost songs of the oni nursemaids, Torachiyo was an elegant young man, strong of body and fair of face. He was once a beloved lieutenant of the Shogun, and he followed her into the dark abyssal realms to repel the defiled ones, winning renown for the oni, whose blood thinned with each passing day.\nNone now sing these songs, but the mask of a horned oni, even in a different form, still possesses power beyond the norm.",
