  "name": "False Worm Bait",
  "description": "This imitation worm bait is made mostly out of condensate, and will twist its body according to the underwater currents, resulting in its fatal attraction to overly-curious fish. Professionals will even add some fruit to it to increase its fragrance and make it utterly irresistable.\n\nSuitable for catching Shirakodai and Angelfish.",
