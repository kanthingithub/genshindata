  "name": "Akai Maou",
  "description": "A stickleback with a fierce appearance and a manner to match. It will fight anyone and anything under the sea for food — a veritable and much-feared robber in red. Its fiery-red coloration seems to have much to do with Pyro, for while they cannot quite become flame generators, they do have some control over high temperatures. They can convert energy from their food and focus it on their dangerous snouts, making them underwater scoundrels indeed.\n\"Need to drill wood to make a flame? This is your best friend.\" — Angler's Atlas, Akai Maou Chapter",
